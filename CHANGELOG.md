# Changelog

## 3.0.1

- Replaced the incorrect loudness data path with the 29-point formula parameter table and direct runtime evaluation.
- Bound automatic volume tracking to the actual playback endpoint selected by Equalizer APO. Capture, missing-endpoint, and endpoint-read failures now bypass correction safely.
- Added a 100 ms dual-bank coefficient crossfade and dense, locally refined peak analysis with a 1 dB headroom margin.
- Preserved the original command and parameter text of 2.0.0 entries until the user explicitly converts them to the enabled formula profile.
- Blocked calibration noise when the selected endpoint is not the Windows default Wave playback device, and clarified the one-speaker SPL measurement procedure.
- Made automatic update checks opt-in and strengthened installer cleanup and rollback behavior.
- Added native runtime regressions for difficult low- and high-frequency peak cases. Release installers remain unsigned; verify the published SHA-256 file before installation.
- Described the feature only as loudness correction; no standards-conformance claim is made.

## 3.0.0

- Restored the data-driven 29-band loudness-correction engine, reference-level controls, manual or endpoint-volume tracking, and pink-noise calibration.
- Rebranded the feature as **Loudness Correction**. The project does not claim standards conformance, certification, endorsement, affiliation, or approval.
- Kept the current GitHub update endpoint and installer checksum workflow.
- Restored the `State`, `ReferenceLevel`, `ReferenceOffset`, `Attenuation`, and optional `Volume` configuration format. Existing 2.0.0 loudness-correction entries open as disabled drafts and must be reviewed and recalibrated before enabling.
